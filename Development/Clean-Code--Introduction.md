## Craftsmanship

Knowledge of principles, practices, patterns, and hueristics.

Good code matters. This premise is one of the most robust, supported, and overloaded of all the premises in our craft.

A programmer with "code =sense" will look at a messy module and see options and variations. It will help that programmer choose the best variation and guide them to plot a sequence of behavior preserving transformations to get from here to there.

> Always check code in a little cleaner than when we checked it out.

## What is Clean Code?

> I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprinicpled optimizations. Clean code does one thing well.

> Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean code never obscures the designer's intent but rahter is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.

> Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. It has unit and acceptance tests. It has meaningful names. It provides one way rather than many ways for doing one thing. It has minimal dependencies, which are explicitly defined, and provides a clear and minimal API. Code should be literate since depending on the language, not all necessary information can be expressed clearly in code alone.

> In recent years I begin, and nearly end, with Beck's rules of simple code. In priority order, simple code:
>
> * Run all the tests.
> * Contains no duplication.
> * Expresses all the design ideas that are in the system.
> * Minimizes the number of entitles cuhc as classes, methods, functions, and the like.

> You know you are working on clean code when each routine you read turns out to be pretty much what you expected. You can call it beautiful code when the code also makes it look like the language was made for the problem.
