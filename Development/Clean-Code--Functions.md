# Functions

What attributes can we give our functions that will allow the casual reader to intuit the kind of program they live inside?

## Small

The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rul of functions is that they should be smaller than that.

Each function should be transparently obvious. Each should tell a story. Each should lead you to the next in a compelling order.

## Blocks and Indenting

The indent level of a function should not be greater than one or two.

## Do One Thing

Functions should do one thing. They should do it well. They should do it only.
