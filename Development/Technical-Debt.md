If you run a commercial kitchen and you only ever cook food, because selling food it your business (if you never clean the dishes, never scrape the grill, never organize the freezer), the health inspector will shut you down pretty quickly.

Software, on the other hand, does not have health inspectors. It has kitchen staff who become more alarmed over time at the state of the kitchen they are working in every day, and if nothing is done about it, there will come a point where the kitchen starts failing to produce edible meals.
