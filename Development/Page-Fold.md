# Beyond the Page Fold

Exploring UX Mythology

## Three Clicks of Destiny

- (not clicks) ease (when following or locating) of experience.

## Beyond the Page Fold (click or scrolling) "Life below 600 pixels"

- 91% of pages can scroll (scroll bar)
- 76% are scrolled
- 22% scroll to bottom of page
- 77% of content on "popular" sites is "below the fold"

## Guided "Faceted" Navigation of Doom

- Limits to "only path" ... limited UX
- Search Patterns
- Balance of breadth and depth

## Hitchiker's Guide to the Home Page

- Megaphone, Billboard, Mission Statement (content versus looking)
- "The Page of Least Importance"
- Bounce-rate or pogoing may indicate issues.

## Lost in White Space ... "margin of terror"

- Cousin to the "page fold"
- Margin/leading spaces resulted in 12.5% comprehension and decrease of 25 WPM reading speed
- Readable, consistent ... Sophisticated and Luxurious
