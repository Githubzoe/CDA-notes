# Boundaries

## Using Third-Party Code

Providers strive for broad applicability so they can work in many environments. Users, on the other hand, want an interface that is focused on their particular needs.

## Exploring and Learning Boundaries

Generate learning tests.

Learning tests are precise experiments that help increase understanding. The tests can be run against new releases to see whether there are behavioral differences. These are considered ourbound tests that exercise the interface the same way production code does.

## Using Code That Does Not Exist Yet

Write a mock interface with the plan to create an adapter to work between code tied to the mock interface and unknown code.
