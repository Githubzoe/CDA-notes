# Comments

Comments are not "pure evil" or "pure good." They are, at best, a necessary evil.

The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourselves in code.

Comments delude and mislead. They det expectations that will never be fulfilled. They lay down old rules that need not, or should not, be followed any longer.

TRUTH can only be found in one place: the code. Only the code can truly tell you what it does.

## Comments do not Make Up for Bad Code

Clear and expressive code with few comments is far superior to cluttered and complex code with lots of comments.

## Explain Yourself in Code

It takes only a few seconds of thought to explain most intent in code.

## Good Comments

* Legal Comments
* Informative Comments
* Explanation of Intent

    Sometimes a comment goes beyond just useful information about the implementation and provides the intent behind a decision.

* Clarification
* Warning of Consequences
* TODO Comments
* Amplification of Importance

Do not use a comment when you can use a function or variable.

## Position Markers

There are rare times when it makes sense to gather certain functions together beneath a banner like this.

## Closing Brace Comments

The serve only to clutter code.

## Commented-Out Code

Few practices are as odious as commenting-out code.

## HTML Comments

In the editor / IDE, comments should be easy to read.

## Nonlocal Information

Make sure only comments written describe the code it appears near.
