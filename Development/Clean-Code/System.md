# Systems

## Separate Constructing a System from Using It

* Factories
* Dependency Injection
* Scaling Up

## Dependency Injection

The class takes no direct steps to resolve its dependencies; it is completely passive. Instead, it provides setter methods or constructor arguments (or both) that are used to inject the dependencies.

## Scaling Up

It is a myth that we can get "systems right the first time." We should implement only today's stories, then refactor and expand the system to implement new stories tomorrow. This is the essence of interative and incremental agility.
