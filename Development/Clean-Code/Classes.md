# Classes

## Classes Should be Small

With functions, size is determined by counting physical lines. With classes, we cound responsibilities.

## The Single Responsibility Principle

A class or module should have one, and only one, reason to change.

## Organizing for Change

For most systems, change is continual. In a clean system classes are organized to reduce the risk of change.

## Isolating from Change

Interfaces and abstract classes help isolate the impact of details that can change. Classes should depend upon abstractions, not on concrete details.
