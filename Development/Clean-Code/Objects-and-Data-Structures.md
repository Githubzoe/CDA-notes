# Objects and Data Structures

## Data / Object Anti-Symmetry

Objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data.

Data structures expose their data and have no meaningful functions.

## Objects

Objects expose behavior and hide data. This makes it easy to add new kinds of objects without changing existing behaviors. It also makes it hard to add new behaviors to existing objects.

## Data Structures

Data structures expose data and have no significant behaviors. This makes it easy to add new behaviors to existing data structures but makes it hard to add new data structures to existing functions.
