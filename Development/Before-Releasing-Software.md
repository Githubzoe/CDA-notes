# Before Releasing Software

When is software ready to be released?

Just as developers always working to improve the product, they should always be working to improve and optimize the release process.

Product teams today are obsessed with "shipping fast", which is great, but it is easy to forget some important things along the way.

## Are the Right Processes, Communication, and Best Practices In Place?

The first step to building quality software is having a quality process. If the process has holes in it, the software will too. Take the time up-front to make sure the process actually works and that communication is a priority ... this will save time in the long run and is a great way to ensure the team is "quality-driven".

Developers should make sure the code supports the requirements they were given. The developers writing the code naturally have a good sense of the overall stability of the software before it goes to testing.

Developers can validate the quality of their code by running unit tests after the code has been written. They can also practice test-driven development (TDD).

The development team should always keep close communication with the rest of the team in order to communicate potential risks or areas of concern.

## What Has / Has Not Been Tested, How And Why?

Developers need to know more than "it's been tested" to feel good about introducing new code to production. They must know what has been tested and how it has been tested in order to feel confident in the release.

Understanding the test coverage (that is, what has/has not been tested) is an important part of the release checklist and ensures the areas that need testing have indeed been tested.

How the software is tested is just as important as whether or not it was tested. If a release candidate has not been tested well, it is very possible to run into problems post-release.

## Has The Designer Seen the Final Designs / Release Candidate?

Designers have an eye for detail and therefore, whenever possible, should always review the final implementation of the work. They can often spot small (but important) issues that can likely be fixed very quickly.

By having the designers involved in validating the release candidate, it gives te developer the chance to bring the quality level up a notch or two.

## Has User Acceptance Testing Been Done?

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) testing helps ensure the software adds value to the business and does not take away from it. When releasing a major update with many new features and functionality, chances are developers will want to coordinate UAT testing to ensure the product owner/client has seen the product and signed off on it.

UAT helps validate the functionality and ensures nothing has been missed that may have been left out of the original requirements. Ultimately, the product owner/client are the ones who can confirm the requirements have indeed been met. For smaller releases, UAT might not be necessary.

## Have External Factors Such As Marketing Events And Holidays Been Considered?

It is important to consider external factors such as marketing events, holidays, and other high-traffic periods that may have an effect on the software. This can go both ways; maybe it is important to get a release out in time for a certain event where many users are going to be exposed to the website/software.

## Is The Support Team Prepared?

Has support been trained on the new features so they know how to answer questions from the customer? Are they aware of changes that will affect customers so they can set the proper expectations? Is help documentation created and available to the customer?

Customer support issues can be reduced or even avoided when the customer-facing team has the chance to review/approve the release and prepare for the changes. After all, how can support actually provide support if they do not know how something works?
