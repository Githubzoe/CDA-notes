Watch out for these sites.

It has a bad reputation that comes from several facts.

1. It's a for-profit resource that is maintained by a closed group of people.
2. It's never disavowed any association with W3C.
2. It's documentation is out of date. It always has been, and this is a consequence of it being a closed resource. There is a LOT of working constantly happening in the worlds of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and if a resource doesnâ€™t keep up, it is a detriment to the programming world, not a benefit.
3. It's almost always lacking in robustness of documentation. They even admit this on the bottom of the page in tiny text.

> Examples might be simplified to improve reading and basic understanding.

Their descriptions of methods will often be completely missing descriptions of optional arguments, and their description of HTML and CSS often is missing huge considerations that are important for complex layouts. Again, this causes active harm.

These are issues because ...

* Their "certifications" carry no weight in the industry, in-fact they could harm a career.
* While this outdatedness and incorrectness may not be a huge concern for seasoned developers but green developers that do not know the right way, may form some bad habits that adjusted over time.
* There should be a demand for the highest level of consistency from reference guides, as they are the ones that will help in time of need. Staying up to date and being correct (no matter how minute of a detail) should be highest on that list.
* With examples of a reference site like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), others should be held to the same standards or better.
