## Mood to Learn

> You won't ALWAYS be in the mood to learn something new. It comes in waves. There may be times where I'm really hyped about learning & then times where I just want to coast for a bit.

> (There is nothing) wrong with not wanting to learn something new every day. Don't be so hard on yourself.

## 100DaysOfCode

1. The software development ecosystem is vast, do not overwhelm yourself. Start off with the basics (i.e. vanilla JavaScript) before frameworks. Learn firsthand why the frameworkd are even necessary.
2. If you get stuck for 30-minutes, ask for help. The more experienced you get, the longer it should be before you need to ask for help again. Be proactice in unblocking yourself.
3. Alternatively, go for a walk or any other activity that is not in front of the computer. Your mind will be refreshed and reset. Coding is mentally taxing. Do not burn yourself out.
4. Have fun. Be creative, play around with the code, make something for yourself. Most learning will come from this, as opposed to a course curriculum.
5. Do not get discouraged if you do not understand things right away, The best developers struggle with their code at some point. Development is one of those things that you understand more by doing.
