## Mood to Learn

> You won't ALWAYS be in the mood to learn something new. It comes in waves. There may be times where I'm really hyped about learning & then times where I just want to coast for a bit.

> (There is nothing) wrong with not wanting to learn something new every day. Don't be so hard on yourself.
