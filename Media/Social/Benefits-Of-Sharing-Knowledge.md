Sharing expertise as a developer ...

* Deepen understanding of a subject.
* Possible job opportunities.
* Help other people.
* Become part of a community.
* Save yourself troubles when you encounter the same issues.

## Cement Your Knowledge

One of the most important benefits is cementing knowledge about the subject. When you teach a topic, you have to research it to ensure you do not teach the wrong things. That forces you to go more in-depth and learn that subject better.

Moreover, you might learn something new. It is common knowledge that in tech things move fast. Maybe the subject you are teaching changed since you first learned it. Thus, it is a great way to stay up-to-date.

> "To teach is to learn twice."

## Opportunities

Sharing knowledge online is a great way to become open to opportunities. People looking at the content can get a rough idea about your knowledge and skills.

Of course, getting opportunities should be the result of your actions; not necessarily the goal.

## Helping Others

When you start, it feels like you are creating content for nobody. No one knows about it at first. But eventually, people will stumble upon your piece of content, and hopefully, they can learn something from it. It is an amazing feeling knowing that the content helped others!

## Community

Another benefit is joining and being part of various communities. This includes meeting and hanging out with like-minded people. Besides making friends and having fun, it can lead to collaborations and opportunities.

Being part of a community ...

* Is fun
* You make friends
* You improve better and quicker
* You are surrounded by like-minded people

## Future Proof

Ae are likely to run into an issue more than once.

Rather than wasting time solving the same problem multiple times, create an article or a video to explain the solution.

Sharing your knowledge is a great way to document the solutions to problems.
