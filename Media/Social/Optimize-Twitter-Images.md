# Optimize Twitter Images

## Profile, Header, and Tweet Image Sizes

Twitter has prescribed sizes and aspect ratios for header, profile, and post pictures. When not following the standards, images can appear skewed, cropped, or lopsided.

### Profile Picture

In 2017, Twitter switched from square to round profile pictures. Now, the standard aspect ratio of 2:1 is no longer acceptable on Twitter. Your avatar should now follow a 1:1 aspect ratio. The recommended size is still 400px X 400px and permissible formats are JPG, PNG, and GIF. The maximum file size is 2MB.

### Twitter Cover Photo

The Twitter header is no longer responsive. Earlier it could be cropped in a hundred different ways, but no longer. Now, it will be a static device-agnostic shape. For banners, Twitter recommends a 3:1 aspect ratio, 1500px X 500px size, and maximum file size of 5MB.

The banner image can be edited on desktops or mobile devices, but theme colors can be updated only on the Twitter website. Images can be in JPG, PNG, or GIF formats, but not animated GIFs.

### Tweeted Images

* Don’t use third-party websites that claim to show how your image will be shown on different devices. Those hardly ever work. 
* Test your image on as many devices you can get your hands on—desktop, tablet, and other mobile devices. 
* Use a private account to test the images for your tweets before posting on your public account. The extra effort can save you loads of embarrassment.
* If you are hard-pressed for time, optimize your images for mobile, on priority. People generally access social apps via mobile devices and they almost never click to see full-size images.
* Twitter may collapse your image so that it fits in the stream. Ensure that you centre-stage important content so that it doesn’t get chopped off.

The ideal image size and aspect ratio are 1200px X 675px and 16:9, respectively. The maximum file size is 5MB for photos and animated GIFs. You can go up to 15MB if you’re posting via their website. 

You can tweet up to four images per post. Two images will appear stacked side by side, both with an aspect ratio of 7:8.
