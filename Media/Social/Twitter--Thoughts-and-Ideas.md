# Twitter: Thoughts and Ideas

## Framework

Threads are the single best way to grow on Twitter.

* If you wanna grow a connection with your followers, a story thread is the way to go.
* If you want to establish an authority in your niche, Process and How To threads are your best friends.
* If you want more sales and clients, you gotta dive deep into problems and solutions.

This framework by Alex Garcia will help you structure a good thread:

1. First Tweet = Hook
2. Body = Context/Story
3. CTA = CTA to follow/click

## Leverage the Timeline

I know we're asked to "get away from the herd" but sometimes being a part of the herd delivers.

Making content on hot topics of the month will guarantee you viewers.

* Leverage what's popular and selling.
* Take advantage of the timeline and popular days of the year.

## Direct Messages

You may have felt shy or lost while DMing your favourite creators.

What do I write ... how do I close and all those uncertain questions.

* DM your loyal followers and thank them for being there with you in your journey. Have a one to one connection with them.
* DM your favourite creators who you've been wanting to reach out to appreciate them on their valuable content.

You can easily start with - "Hey <name> Just wanted to send greetings for the New Year. You've been ....." and end with - "Wishing you and your family a very Happy and prosperous New Year"

## Challenges

### Send out a Good Morning Tweet

Some formats to help you out:

* “Gm to everyone..”
* Your morning routine update
* “Good Morning, today my goal is..”

### Ask Questions for Engagement

Something as simple as:

* What's your favorite quote?
* What is your best tip to making money online?
* What advice would you give to your 18 y/o version?
* Is college a scam? lol
* Are get rich quick courses a scam?

### Write a List in a Tweet

Draft one and show yourself off as an authority of your niche.

* Top 5 books that changed my life
* Cheat codes of life
* Hacks to a fulfilling day -> Meditation, walks etc.
* Skills that will make you money
* 5 of my favourite creators on Twitter

Pro tip - End with "What about you?" or "What else?" to get some replies and engagement.

Find something that goes BAM and you can easily go viral with it.
